/// The `Packable3` trait is used to fit an object inside a 61-bit number. This trait is unsafe as
/// it can transmute and alias objects, it can also break Rust's borrowing and memory model.
/// # Examples
///
/// Safe implementations of Packable3 are types that do not implement Drop, such as small numbers.
///
/// ```
/// use tagged_ptr::packable3::Packable3;
/// fn main() {
///     let x = unsafe{5u32.pack()};
///     let y = unsafe{u32::unpack(x)};
///     assert_eq!(5, y)
/// }
